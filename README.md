# monorepo

**The goal for this project is to help you get fundamentals of backend engineering.** We will be focusing on the following areas:

- Intro to blockchains
- Tools, languages and packages
- Code structure, patterns and organization
- Testing
- Using external APIs
- Exposing APIs

At the end, we want to expose an api that returns the best time for bridging tokens via Stargate or any reasonable bridge.

This repo has some of the code snippets you need for being able to successfully complete this project. Some of the work will be split in weeks so that you can easily follow allow and do the work needed. Here is the rough outline of how we will progress. Each week, we build on the work from the previous week. The code for week `x` is saved in the branch called `felix-week-x`

**Week 1**: `[Intro to blockchains]` Blockchain concepts and intro

- What are blockchains
- Tokens (fungible and non-fungible)
- Bridges

**Week 2**: `[Tools, languages and packages]` Protect setup and tools

- Nodejs
- Typescript
- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL
- Docker
- Axios / ethers

**Week 3**: `[Using external APIs]` `[Intro to blockchains]` Cost of bridging USDC from Ethereum using Stargate

- Intro to smart contracts
- Intro to smart contract tokens: ERC20
- ABIs
- Gas fees
- Writing from blockchains
- Listening to blockchain events

**Week 4**: `[Tools, languages and packages]` Saving data to postgreSQL

- Typeorm
- Migrations
- Relational databases and PostgreSQL

**Week 5**: `[Testing]` Testing

- Integration tests
- Unit tests

**Week 6**: `[Exposing APIs]` GraphQL

- Exposing data to the external world
- Serving requests

**Week 7**: `[Exposing APIs]` Coingecko API + Twitter (optional)

**Week 8**: Wrap up
